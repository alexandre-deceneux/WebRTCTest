# Application test

## Introduction

The goal of this test is to create a peer to peer application to send binary data from on browser tab to another, using the RTCDataChannel of the WebRTC HTML5 API.

Web RTC is an API that allows direct browser-to-browser communication. It's widely used for video chats, but it can be used for many things, including peer-to-peer video delivery like we do at Streamroot.
